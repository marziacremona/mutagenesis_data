# Mutagenesis data

High-resolution neutral mutation rates analyzed in the paper [Probabilistic K-mean with local alignment for clustering and motif discovery in functional data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04773). 

Mutation rates (substitutions, insertions and deletions) are estimated using the pipeline presented in [Kuruppumullage Don et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1221792110).
